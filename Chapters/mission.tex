\textbf{``To design and manufacture a Star Tracker based Attitude Determination System for CubeSats and test its performance onboard the PSLV Stage-4 Orbital Platform''}

A lot of upcoming avenues in CubeSat development and usage, such as rendezvous \& docking and formation flying, and just as many established ones like earth observation, require the attitude of the satellite with a high level of accuracy. This level of accuracy can be achieved by using a star tracking system onboard the satellite. The attitude estimate attained using such systems is usually much better than that obtained by more conventional methods that use magmeters and photo-diodes.

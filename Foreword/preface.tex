The IITB-SSP team started working on designing the Star Tracker-based Attitude Determination System in August 2019. The requirements were listed down in a top to down process. After almost a year of work on the design, the following design of the system has been conceptualized. This report gives an insight to the work done till now. It includes all the major decisions taken and the rationales behind them. This report will serve as a building block for further improvements in the design.
